### Details

The Action@id attribute is used internally as the identifier for each action.
It is therefore mandatory and needs to follow a number of rules:
- Each action should have a unique id.
- Should be an unsigned integer.
- Only plain numbers are allowed (no leading signs, no leading zeros, no scientific notation, etc).
