# CheckContentTag

## MissingTag

<!-- Description, Properties, ... sections are auto-generated. -->
<!-- REPLACE ME AUTO-GENERATION -->

### Details

Typically, a non-empty 'Group/Content' is mandatory on groups except for the following exceptional cases where the Content tag should be ommitted:
- Multi-threaded groups
- When the protocol doesn't have any group at all. In that case, it is needed to add a Group without any content.
