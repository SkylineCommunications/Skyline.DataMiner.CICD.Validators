<!-- REPLACE ME AUTO-GENERATION -->

### Details

The minimum allowed value for a Timer Time is '1'.
The maximum allowed value for a Timer Time tag is '2.073.600.000' which corresponds to 24 days.
An altenative possible value is 'loop' which will cause the timer to continuously go off.

Also note that, due to a software issue, a value higher than '86.400.000' which corresponds to 24 hours will cause issues on DMA version between 8.5.9.1 and 9.0 CU5.
