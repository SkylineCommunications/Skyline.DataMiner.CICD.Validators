<!-- REPLACE ME AUTO-GENERATION -->

### Details

Connections can be defined either via 'Protocol/Type' or via 'Protocol/Connections' but both syntaxes can not be used in the same protocol.
- 'Protocol/Type' is the recommended syntax.
- 'Protocol/Connections' should only be used in case one of the rare features only available in this syntax is needed.
