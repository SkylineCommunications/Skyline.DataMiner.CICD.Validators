## ConditionCanBeSimplified

<!-- 'Description' and 'Properties' sections are auto-generated. -->
<!-- DON'T TOUCH ME - I'M USED BY VALIDATOR DOC AUTO-GENERATION CODE -->

### Details

The 'QAction/Condition' can be simplified. Some examples of when the condition can be simplified:
  - The condition contains redundant parentheses.
  - The condition does not contain a variable and therefore can either be dropped completely (or a variable must be included).
