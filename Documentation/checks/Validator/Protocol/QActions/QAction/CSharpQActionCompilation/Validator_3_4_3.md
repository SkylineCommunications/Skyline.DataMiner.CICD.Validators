### Details

No C# QAction code analysis could be performed due to following mismatch in supported C# syntax versions:
- C# syntax up to and including version 7.3 is supported by the protocol (see 'Compliancies/MinimumRequiredVersion' tag).
- C# 7.3 syntax is not supported by this Visual Studio (See Visual Studio version).
