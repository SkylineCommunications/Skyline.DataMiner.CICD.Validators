# CheckDynamicIndexAttribute

## MissingDynamicIdAttribute

<!-- Description, Properties, ... sections are auto-generated. -->
<!-- REPLACE ME AUTO-GENERATION -->

### Details

'Group@dynamicIndex' attribute allows to filter on Display Keys before creating dynamic DCF interfaces.
Such filter is applied on the table referred to via the 'Group@dynamicId' attribute.
This means that the presence of a 'Group@dynamicIndex' attribute while there is no 'Group@dynamicIndex' doesn't make sense.
