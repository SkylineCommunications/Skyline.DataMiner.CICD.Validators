# CheckIdAttribute

## DuplicatedId

<!-- Description, Properties, ... sections are auto-generated. -->
<!-- REPLACE ME AUTO-GENERATION -->

### Details

The id attribute is used internally as the identifier for each parameterGroup.
It is therefore mandatory and needs to follow a number of rules:
- Each parameterGroup should have a unique id.
- Should be an unsigned integer.
- Only plain numbers are allowed (no leading signs, no leading zeros, no scientific notation, etc).
